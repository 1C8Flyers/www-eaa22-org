      <h1>Keep Aviation Thriving in Rockford</h1>
      <p>For nearly 70 years, EAA Chapter 22 has served Rockford from our home at Cottonwood Airport on the west side. What began as a small group of aviators has grown into a lasting community asset — introducing youth to flight, providing aviation education, and keeping grassroots aviation accessible in our city.</p>
      <p>Your support helps ensure aviation opportunity remains part of Rockford’s future.</p>
