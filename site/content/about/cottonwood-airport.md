# Cottonwood Airport — 1C8

Cottonwood Airport has been a cornerstone of Rockford-area grassroots aviation since the late 1940s. The original application was made in 1946, and the airport certificate was issued in 1947. Early plans included north-south and east-west grass runways that made Cottonwood an accessible local training and recreational field.

For decades, nearly every local pilot in training crossed paths with Cottonwood. The field shifted through different ownership periods and operating statuses, but remained deeply important to the aviation community.

## A Natural Home for Chapter 22

Cottonwood and EAA Chapter 22 grew together over time. Early chapter members and founders gathered here, built aircraft here, and held chapter events here.

The airport became especially significant as other local fields changed or closed. As pilots and aircraft relocated, Cottonwood continued to provide a practical and community-focused home base.

## Preserving the Field

In June 1985, the Cottonwood Corporation was formed to purchase the airport and prevent permanent closure. Aviation supporters raised the down payment through local stock ownership, creating a member-driven model that reflected EAA values.

That preservation effort ensured Cottonwood would remain active and available for future generations of pilots, builders, and chapter members.

## Continuing Role Today

As we celebrate the airport's 80th anniversary in 2026, Cottonwood remains the home of EAA Chapter 22 activities and a living part of the region’s aviation story. Its identity is still rooted in the same principles that shaped it decades ago:

- Preservation of a historic grass-strip airport
- Aircraft building, restoration, and learning
- Fellowship through flying and volunteer service

Cottonwood Airport is more than a place to land — it is a long-running partnership in community aviation.
