# The EAA Convention — Rockford Years (1959–1969)

Before Oshkosh became the home of the world’s largest aviation celebration, the EAA Fly-In Convention found its roots in Rockford, Illinois. From 1959 through 1969, Rockford hosted a formative era of EAA history that helped define the organization’s culture, scale, and identity.

## A Humble Beginning

In 1959, EAA moved its annual fly-in from Milwaukee to Rockford to support growing attendance. Early Rockford conventions retained a close-knit, grassroots atmosphere where homebuilders, restorers, and aviation enthusiasts gathered to display aircraft, exchange ideas, and celebrate flight.

Camp life and camaraderie were central to the experience. Many attendees camped under their wings, and chapter friendships formed that lasted a lifetime. A memorable tradition from the era was the “dawn patrol,” often associated with the buzzing wake-up passes of Ray Hegy’s tiny red biplane, *El Chuparosa*.

## Growth and Excitement in the 1960s

As the decade progressed, the Rockford convention expanded dramatically. Homebuilts remained the heart of the event, while antiques, warbirds, and aerobatic performances broadened its appeal.

Notable highlights included:

- **The Breezy’s debut (1965)** — Charles Roloff and Carl Unger’s open-frame design became an instant crowd favorite.
- **Warbirds presence (mid-1960s)** — WWII-era aircraft helped bring living aviation history to the flightline.
- **Daily airshows** — performers such as Bob Hoover elevated the convention experience.

By the late 1960s, the event drew national attention, with crowds exceeding 100,000 and thousands of aircraft filling the field.

## The Final Rockford Convention

By 1969, convention growth had outpaced available facilities in Rockford. That year marked the final EAA convention held there. In 1970, the fly-in moved to Wittman Regional Airport in Oshkosh, where it evolved into today’s EAA AirVenture Oshkosh.

## Enduring Legacy

Although the convention moved, the Rockford years remain foundational to EAA’s identity. The values that defined that era — innovation, volunteerism, fellowship, and hands-on aviation — continue to shape Chapter 22 and EAA communities everywhere.
