Chapter 22 supports future aviators through scholarship funding, mentorship, and community-backed flight training opportunities.

## Ray Aviation Scholarship

The EAA Ray Aviation Scholarship is funded by the Ray Foundation, managed by EAA, and administered through local EAA chapters. Through this program, EAA provides up to **$12,000** per selected scholar to help cover flight-training expenses.

When Chapter 22 is awarded a scholarship slot, we select and support a local youth candidate and mentor them throughout training toward pilot certification.

## Who Can Apply

Eligibility follows current EAA Ray Aviation Scholarship guidelines:

- **Ages 16–19** pursuing a **Private Pilot** or **Sport Pilot** certificate
- **Ages 15–19** pursuing a **Glider Pilot** certificate

## Chapter 22 Program Impact

For multiple recent years, Chapter 22 has supported teen flight students with funding and mentoring as they worked toward pilot certification. In addition to national scholarship opportunities, chapter fundraising and donor generosity have also helped us provide supplemental local support to students progressing through training.

We are also grateful for access to training aircraft and instructors at modest rates, helping scholarship dollars go farther and serve more aspiring pilots.
