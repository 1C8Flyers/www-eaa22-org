## Who it's for

- Youth ages **8–17**
- Families interested in aviation pathways
- Students who want an inspiring first step into flight training

## What participants can expect

- A short preflight/ground orientation
- A flight with a qualified volunteer pilot (typically around 20 minutes)

- Encouragement to continue learning through aviation education resources

Young Eagles flights are provided through volunteer support and chapter participation.
