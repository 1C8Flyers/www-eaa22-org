The Rockford Composite Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is an integral part of the Rockford aviation community. Chapter 22 is proud to support and collaborate with its members. As the **official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force**, CAP provides vital emergency services, cadet programs, and aerospace education..

## Cadet-Focused Mission

On the cadet side, CAP provides a structured leadership and aerospace program for youth, helping develop character, confidence, discipline, and aviation knowledge. Cadets gain opportunities through:

- Aerospace education and hands-on aviation exposure
- Leadership development and character-building
- Physical fitness and personal growth
- Orientation flights and aviation career inspiration
- Teamwork, service, and mission-focused training

## Partnership with EAA Chapter 22

Chapter 22 and the Rockford Composite Squadron share a close partnership centered on youth development and aviation engagement. Many Chapter 22 members are also active in CAP, and that overlap strengthens mentoring, volunteer support, and program collaboration across both organizations.

Together, we create more opportunities for young people to discover aviation and build lifelong skills.

At Chapter events, it is common to see CAP cadets in uniform helping operations run smoothly. Cadets regularly support setup and teardown, greeting attendees, directing visitors, assisting with logistics, and backing safety-minded event flow. Their professionalism and service mindset are a visible part of what makes many Chapter 22 events successful and welcoming.

## CAP Core Missions and Duties

Civil Air Patrol serves communities through three core missions:

- **Cadet Programs** — youth leadership, aerospace education, character development, and flight exposure
