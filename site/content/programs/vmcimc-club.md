title: "VMC/IMC Club"

The Chapter 22 **VMC/IMC Club** is a discussion-based safety program where pilots and aviation enthusiasts work through realistic flying scenarios.

Sessions focus on practical aeronautical decision-making for both visual and instrument conditions, with emphasis on weather interpretation, risk management, and "what would you do?" choices.

This is a low-pressure learning environment designed to improve confidence and safety through shared experience.
